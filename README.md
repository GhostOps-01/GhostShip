> Whether you’re pushing React, Node, GraphQL, or anything in between — **GhostShip** hunts down what matters and prepares your code for battle.

# GhostShip

GhostShip is your all-in-one test readiness engine — mapping components, injecting `data-*` tags, scanning PRs for missing test coverage, and scaffolding test logic across frontend and backend systems.

It’s the core of a bigger mission: making QA faster, smarter, and automatic — from DOM tagging to CI test audits.

## SmokeBot+ | Ultra-Lightweight AI-Powered Cypress Framework

A prototype from the TestGhost ecosystem – featuring modular agents like GhostShip and SmokeBot+.

### What is SmokeBot+?

SmokeBot+ is a plug-and-play, zero-config Cypress automation framework powered by AI-driven heuristics. It’s designed to generate full-stack smoke tests from a single URL input — ideal for QA engineers, devs, and testers who want instant feedback on the health of any webpage, from header to footer.

### Why SmokeBot+?

- **Instant Setup** – One command installs and configures Cypress, generates your first test, and drops it into your suite  
- **Full-Page Awareness** – Uses static heuristics (and eventually, AI vision) to find common structure points like headers, footers, CTAs, and form fields  
- **Modular Intelligence** – Part of the GhostShip framework – a growing collection of task-specific QA agents (e.g. DOM taggers, test suggesters, CI analyzers)  
- **CI-Ready by Design** – Built for GitHub integration, future PR scanning, and smart test routing

## Getting Started

### With `npx`:

```
npx smokebot+ init
```

### Or manually:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/smokebot_plus.git
cd smokebot_plus
npm install
npm run smokebot -- https://yourtargeturl.com
```

This generates:

```
cypress/
  └── e2e/
      └── generated_smoketest.cy.js
```

## 🚧 Project Roadmap

### ✅ Core Features
- **One-click smoke test generation**  
- **DOM tag injector bot** — *(in development)* using the GhostShip tagging engine  
- **PR code analyzer** — classify changes: `frontend`, `backend`, `config`

### 🧠 AI & Smart Tools
- **AI test suggestion engine** — static + AI-assisted heuristics  
- **Auto-generate missing test stubs** — prompts you for approval  
- **Detect redundant tests** — scans codebase for similar logic  
- *Future:* Full AI-based test writing & reasoning

### 🔁 CI / DX Integration
- **CI automation** — GitHub Actions + test classification triggers  
- **GUI Installer Wizard** — built for non-terminal workflows

## GhostShip & TestGhost – Coming Soon

SmokeBot+ is just one agent in a growing fleet:

### TestGhost

	-	CI-native orchestrator that watches pull requests
	- Detects test coverage gaps in real-time
	- Posts actionable PR comments (e.g. “missing tests in PaymentForm.jsx”)
	- Works across Cypress, unit, API, and GraphQL layers
	- Can optionally auto-generate test scaffolds (and ask for approval before committing)
	- Scans your codebase for existing similar components/tests to avoid redundancy
	- Future support for AI-assisted test reasoning and smart suggestions

### GhostShip

- DOM-tagging and component-recognition engine  
- Injects structured `data-*` tags into form fields, buttons, headers, and other testable elements  
- Maps these elements back to source components, with optional IDE hooks  
-	Future support for VS Code, other popular IDEs, and CLI tooling.

Together, they form the **TestGhost Ecosystem** — modular QA bots that whisper sweet coverage dreams into your CI pipelines.
