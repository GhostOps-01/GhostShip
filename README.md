# 🛠️ GhostShip — Test Intelligence Engine

**GhostShip** is the modular heart of the TestGhost ecosystem — a test readiness engine that injects structure, visibility, and intelligence into your QA stack. It’s not just a repo — it’s a launchpad for every QA innovation we ship.

Whether you’re working with React, GraphQL, or bare metal — GhostShip makes your code testable, trackable, and CI-ready.

## ✅ Core Mission

- 🔍 **Map and tag UI elements** with precision using our DOM tagging utilities

- ⚙️ **Scaffold test logic** automatically with optional AI-assisted tools
- 🔌 **Plug into any stack** — CI, GitHub, Cypress, Postman, etc.
- 🛠️ **Power your internal QA agents**, from data-tag injectors to test runners
