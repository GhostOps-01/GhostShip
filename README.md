> Whether you’re pushing React, Node, GraphQL, or anything in between — **GhostShip** hunts down what matters and prepares your code for battle.

# GhostShip

GhostShip is your all-in-one test readiness engine — mapping components, injecting `data-*` tags, scanning PRs for missing test coverage, and scaffolding test logic across frontend and backend systems.

It’s the core of a bigger mission: making QA faster, smarter, and automatic — from DOM tagging to CI test audits.

# 🚢 SmokeBot+ | Ultra-Lightweight AI-Powered Cypress Framework

> *A prototype from the TestGhost ecosystem – featuring modular agents like GhostShip and SmokeBot+.*

---

## ⚡ What is SmokeBot+?

SmokeBot+ is a plug-and-play, zero-config Cypress automation framework powered by AI-driven heuristics. It’s designed to **generate full-stack smoke tests** from a single URL input — ideal for QA engineers, devs, and testers who want **instant feedback** on the health of any webpage, from header to footer.

This isn’t your grandpa’s testing tool. SmokeBot+ is part of the larger **TestGhost** initiative – an experimental suite of intelligent, modular test bots designed to **autonomously explore, tag, generate, and validate** web apps with minimal setup.

---

## Why SmokeBot+?

-  **Instant Setup**: One command installs and configures Cypress, generates your first test, and drops it into your suite.
-  **Full-Page Awareness**: Uses static heuristics (and eventually, AI vision) to find common structure points like headers, footers, CTAs, and form fields.
-  **Modular Intelligence**: Part of the GhostShip framework – a growing collection of task-specific QA agents (e.g. DOM taggers, test suggesters, CI analyzers).
-  **CI-Ready by Design**: Built for GitHub integration, future PR scanning, and smart test routing.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

```bash
npx smokebot+ init

**Or manually
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/smokebot_plus.git
cd smokebot_plus
npm install
npm run smokebot -- https://yourtargeturl.com
**This generates

🪄 GhostShip & TestGhost – Coming Soon

SmokeBot+ is just one agent in a growing fleet:

👻 TestGhost
	•	The CI-native orchestrator that watches pull requests.
	•	Detects test coverage gaps in real-time.
	•	Posts actionable PR comments (e.g. “missing tests in PaymentForm.jsx”).
	•	Works across Cypress, unit, API, and GraphQL layers.

🧠 GhostShip
	•	A DOM-tagging and component-recognition engine.
	•	Injects structured data-* tags into form fields, buttons, headers, and other testable elements.
	•	Maps these elements back to source components, with optional IDE hooks.
	•	Future support for VS Code integration and CLI tooling.

Together, they form the TestGhost Ecosystem — modular QA bots that whisper sweet coverage dreams into your CI pipelines.
